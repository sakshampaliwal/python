Alright Saksham, let‚Äôs kick off your FastAPI journey with a clean, beginner-friendly **CRUD app idea** that actually mimics something real-world‚Äîbut still simple enough to grasp the full flow.

---

### üß† **Project Idea**: *"Task Manager API"* (To-Do App)

A basic API to manage tasks (like a Trello-lite or personal to-do list backend). You‚Äôll be doing all the Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on tasks.

---

### üì¶ **Entities (aka Models)**

Just one model to keep it chill:

```python
Task:
    id (int)
    title (string)
    description (string)
    status (enum: pending/done)
    created_at (datetime)
```

---

### üí• **CRUD Operations You‚Äôll Build**

| Operation | Endpoint             | Description                    |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Create    | `POST /tasks/`       | Add a new task                 |
| Read      | `GET /tasks/`        | Get all tasks                  |
| Read      | `GET /tasks/{id}`    | Get one task by ID             |
| Update    | `PUT /tasks/{id}`    | Update task (title/status/etc) |
| Delete    | `DELETE /tasks/{id}` | Delete task                    |

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Tech Stack for V1**

* **FastAPI** ‚Äì for the web framework
* **Pydantic** ‚Äì for data validation
* **Uvicorn** ‚Äì as the ASGI server
* **SQLite** ‚Äì for super simple storage
* **SQLAlchemy (or even just a Python list for now)** ‚Äì for ORM or dummy DB

### üõ† Behind-the-Scenes Goals (Why This Project is üî• for Learning)

| Concept                | How You'll Learn It                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| HTTP Methods           | GET, POST, PUT, DELETE                    |
| Request validation     | Using Pydantic models                     |
| Auto-generated Swagger | FastAPI gives this out of the box         |
| Dependency Injection   | With DB session if you go with SQLAlchemy |
| Response Models        | Using `response_model=` in FastAPI        |
| Error handling         | Try/except + `HTTPException` usage        |
| Status Codes           | Proper `status_code=201`, etc.            |

### üß≠ Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Set up the project**:

   ```bash
   mkdir task-manager-api && cd task-manager-api
   python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. **Create your FastAPI app**:

   ```python
   # main.py
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   def home():
       return {"message": "Task Manager API"}
   ```

3. **Define your `Task` model using Pydantic**

4. **Create an in-memory storage (start with a list of dicts)**

5. **Write all the endpoints one by one**

6. **Test in Swagger UI**: Run `uvicorn main:app --reload` and open [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

7. **(Optional later)**: Swap in SQLite with SQLAlchemy for real DB experience

### üîÆ Once you're comfy...

Later you can add:

* ‚úÖ JWT-based auth (login/signup)
* ‚úÖ Filtering tasks by status
* ‚úÖ Pagination
* ‚úÖ Dockerize it

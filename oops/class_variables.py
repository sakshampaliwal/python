# Accessing class variable from instances
car1.describe()     # Output: Maruti Swift has 4 wheels.

# Access class variable using class name (preferred)
print(Car.traffic_rules)     # Output: Follow speed limits...

# Access from instance (also works but not preferred)

print(f"car2 wheels: {car2.wheels}")  # 6 (still uses class variable)
